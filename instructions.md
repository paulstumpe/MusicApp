# Music Project
For this project, you will be using React to show the albums of your favorite
artist.
## What to do
You will need to use the [iTunes JSON
API](https://affiliate.itunes.apple.com/resources/documentation/itunes-store-webservice-search-api/) to grab the albums of an artist.
Then, display the albums on a React page. For each album you will need to display:
* Artist Name
* Album Name
* Year Released
* Album Art
Feel free to be creative on how you display and style the albums. You may want to
include any extra metadata that you find useful.
